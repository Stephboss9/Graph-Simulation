# Mini_Google_Maps

This is an application that allows a user to build a graph of a region in the U.S or anywhere they desire consisting of roads and cities/towns. Towns
represent the nodes of the graph, and the line segements connecting the nodes are the roads. Some of the things the user can do is find out which roads are connected
to a specefic city/town, find the road connecting two cities/towns given the road, find the shortest path between two towns(implemented using a similar version of dijkstras
shortest path algorithm), and much more.
