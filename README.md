# Mini_Google_Maps

This is an application that allows a user to build a map of a region of anywhere they desire consisting of roads and cities/towns. I implemented a Graph data structure to represent the map using Hashsets to store the towns and roads.  The towns are instances of the town class and represent the nodes of the graph, and the line segements connecting the nodes are the roads. Some of the things the user can do is find out which roads are connected to a specefic city/town, find the road connecting two cities/towns given the road, find the shortest path between two towns(implemented using a similar version of dijkstras shortest path algorithm), and much more. 

Concepts applied:
Object Oriented Programming 
Data Structures
THe application comes with a JavaFX GUI.
